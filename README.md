# BecomeNextJsDeveloper

From Zero to React to Next.js developer.

# Overview

This will be an overview of the resources I found useful in learning to become a fullstack developer.
## Goals

Whilst learning I set the below basic goals I wanted to achieve.

1. Learn sufficient amount of HTML and CSS.
2. Learn Javascript/Typescript.
3. Learn React.
4. Learn Next.js
5. Learn different backends.
6. Create working Next.js website.

## Backends Covered
The is a list of some backends I will try to cover and learn. They should be covered in the examples. If multiple examples needed I will use Next.js and the branch will have _firebase or _supabase appended onto it.
- [ ] Firebase
- [ ] Supabase
- [ ] Strapi
    - [ ] PostgreSQL
- [ ] Custom Next.js API
    - [ ] MongoDB
    - [ ] PostgreSQL

## Examples/Lessons

I will be creating some exmaple websites for both React and Next.js. They will be there own branch each and will be following this naming convention 01_Title_Framework. The beginning number will be the lesson order, followed by example name title, followed by framework. The examples will become more advanced with a backend being needed. The backend that will most likely be used will be Firebase as it has an easy to use free tier. A folder will be created with documentation on how the backend was created. I will aim to use mutliple backend to gain  more experience.

Examples/Lessons (Coming):

- [ ] Example 1
